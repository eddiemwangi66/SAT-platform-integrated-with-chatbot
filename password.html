    <h1>Password Security</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In today's digital world, passwords are the keys to our online kingdoms – email, bank accounts, social media, 
        and more. But just like a flimsy lock can't keep out a determined burglar, a weak password can't stop a cybercriminal. 
        This module will equip you with the knowledge to create strong, secure passwords and protect your valuable information.</p>
    <p>Password security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity as passwords serve as the primary method
         of authentication for accessing various systems, accounts, and resources. Educating users about 
         strong password practices helps protect sensitive information and prevents unauthorized access.</p>
   <p>We use many different passwords and systems. Many password managers will store a user's
     passwords for them so the user does not have to remember all their passwords for multiple systems. 
    The greatest disadvantage of these solutions is the risk of compromise of the password manager.</p>
    <p>These password managers may be protected by a weak password or passphrase chosen by the user and 
        easily compromised. There have been many cases where a person's private data was stored by a 
        cloud provider but easily accessed by unauthorized persons through password compromise.</p>
        <p>Organizations should encourage the use of different passwords for different systems and
             should provide a recommended password management solution for its users.</p>
             <p><b>Examples of poor password protection that should be avoided are:</b>

                <p>1) Reusing passwords for multiple systems, especially using the same password for business and personal
                     use.</p>
                     <p>2) Writing down passwords and leaving them in unsecured areas.</p>
                        <p>3) Sharing a password with tech support or a co-worker.</p></p>

        <p> The following are some of the recommended approach while setting up passwords:</p>
        <h5>Create Strong Passwords</h5>
        <p>1) Length: Aim for at least 16 characters—longer passwords are stronger. <br>
            2) Randomness: Use a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols. <br>
            3) Consider using a passphrase (a memorable phrase of unrelated words) for added security. Get creative with
             spelling and add numbers or symbols. For example: <br>
            <b>Strong:</b> HorsePurpleHatRunBaconShoes <br>
            <b>Stronger:</b> HorsPerpleHatRunBayconShoos <br>
            <b>Strongest:</b> HorsPerpleHat#1RunBayconShoos <br>
            A strong password should be complex and difficult to guess. It typically includes a combination of upper
             and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
         </p>

        <h5>Unique Passwords</h5>
        <p>Use a different strong password for each account. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple sites. <br>
            For example: <br>
            Bank: k8dfh8c@Pfv0gB2 <br>
            Email account: LmvF%swVR56s2mW <br>
            Social media account: e246gs%mFs#3tv6 <br>
            <b>Don't Repeat Yourself:</b> Never use the same password for multiple accounts. A single breach can have a domino effect. <br>
            <b>Avoid the Obvious:</b> Ditch personal information like birthdays, names, or addresses. Hackers often target these first.
        </p>

        <h5>Regular Password Updates:</h5>
        <p> Regularly update passwords, especially for critical accounts and services.
            Avoid predictable patterns when updating passwords. <br>
             Instead of simply incrementing a number at the end of a password, create entirely new passwords.</p>
        
        <h5>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</h5>   
        <p>Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional information beyond just a password. This could be a code sent to a mobile device, a fingerprint scan, or a hardware token.
            <br>Enable MFA wherever possible, especially for sensitive accounts and services.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Topics covered</h2>
    <p>In this section we shall cover some of the crucial topics that you as a user should be educated about and made
        aware of. The  cybersecurity awareness training curricula should reflect an organization's risk-based priorities 
        -- as well as, ideally, individual users' roles -- some topics are universally important. </p>
