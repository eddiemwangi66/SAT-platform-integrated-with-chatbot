    <h1>Social Engineering</h1>
    <p>Social engineering attacks are a popular choice among threat actors. That’s because
         it’s often easier to trick people into providing them with access, information, or
          money than it is to exploit a software or network vulnerability.</p>
   <p>
    <b>social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information,
     access, or valuables.Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique used by attackers to
      trick individuals into divulging confidential information, performing actions, or bypassing security controls. </b>
       It's an umbrella term that can apply to a broad range of attacks. Each technique
      is designed to capitalize on the trusting nature of people and their willingness to help. 
   </p>
     <p>Social engineering is a form of deception that takes advantage of the way people think. It preys on 
    people's natural feelings of curiosity, generosity, and excitement. Threat actors turn those feelings
     against their targets by affecting their better judgment. Social engineering attacks can be incredibly
      harmful because of how easy they can be to accomplish.</p>

      <h3>Social engineering tactics</h3>
      <p>Social engineering attacks are a popular choice among threat actors. That’s because it’s often 
        easier to trick people into providing them with access, information, or money than it is to exploit
         a software or network vulnerability.</p>
         <p>As you might recall, social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error
            to gain private information, access, or valuables. It's an umbrella term that can apply to a 
            broad range of attacks. Each technique is designed to capitalize on the trusting nature of people 
            and their willingness to help. In this reading, you will learn about specific social engineering 
            tactics to watch out for. You’ll also learn ways that organizations counter these threats.</p>

        <h5>Types of Social Engineering Attacks:</h5>    
        <p>1) Phishing: Attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into providing sensitive information,
             such as passwords or financial details. <br>
           2) Pretexting: Attackers create a fabricated scenario or pretext to trick individuals into revealing information or performing actions. <br>
           3) Baiting: Attackers offer something enticing, such as a free download or USB drive, containing malware or malicious links. <br>
           4) Spear Phishing: Targeted phishing attacks customized for specific individuals or organizations, often using personal information to increase
             credibility. <br>
           5) Vishing (Voice Phishing): Attackers use phone calls or voice messages to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information or 
            performing actions. <br>
           6) Smishing (SMS Phishing): Phishing attacks conducted via text messages, typically containing malicious links or requests for sensitive
             information. <br>
           7) Tailgating: Physically following someone into a restricted area or building by exploiting their politeness or trust. <br>
           8) Impersonation: Pretending to be someone else, such as a trusted colleague or authority figure, to gain access to information or resources.
             
        </p>

           <h5>Recognizing Social Engineering Attempts</h5>  
           <p>1) Requests for sensitive information, such as passwords, account numbers, or personal details, especially via unsolicited emails or messages. <br>
           2) Urgent or alarming messages urging immediate action, often with threats of consequences for non-compliance. <br>
           3) Unusual or unexpected requests, especially from unfamiliar or suspicious sources. <br>
           4) Requests for information that should not be shared publicly or with unauthorized individuals. <br>
           5) Unusual or uncharacteristic behavior from supposed colleagues or acquaintances. <br>

           </p>

           <h5>Mitigating Social Engineering Risks:</h5>
           <p>1) Employee Training: Provide comprehensive training and awareness programs to educate employees about social engineering tactics 
            and how to recognize and respond to them. <br>
            2) Security Policies and Procedures: Establish clear policies and procedures for handling sensitive information and verifying requests
             for information or actions. <br>
           3) Verification and Validation: Encourage individuals to verify requests for sensitive information or actions through alternative channels, 
           such as contacting known phone numbers or email addresses. <br>
           4) Technological Controls: Implement email filtering, spam detection, and intrusion detection systems to identify and block social engineering
            attacks. <br>
           5) Incident Response: Develop incident response plans to quickly detect, respond to, and mitigate the impact of social engineering attacks.</p>

                <p>In this section we shall cover some of the crucial topics that you as a user should be educated about and made
                    aware of. The  cybersecurity awareness training curricula should reflect an organization's risk-based priorities 
                    -- as well as, ideally, individual users' roles -- some topics are universally important. </p>
