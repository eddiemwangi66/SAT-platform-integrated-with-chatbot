        <h1>Welcome to the Phishing education page</h1>
        <p>phishing is the use of digital communications
             to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. </p>
             <p>phishing attacks appear to come from a trusted person or business. This can lead 
                unsuspecting recipients into acting against their better judgment, causing them to break security procedures.</p>
                <p>An attack that attempts to misdirect legitimate users to malicious websites through the abuse of URLs or hyperlinks
                    in emails could be considered phishing.</p>
        <h3>The origins of phishing</h3>

       <p>Phishing has been around since the early days of the internet. It can be traced back to the 1990s. At the
         time, people across the world were coming online for the first time. As the internet became more accessible it 
         began to attract the attention of malicious actors. These malicious actors realized that the internet gave them
          a level of anonymity to commit their crimes.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of phishing</h2>  
        <p>A number of techniques began to appear around this time period, many of which are still used today. 
            There are five common types of phishing that every security analyst should know:</p>
            <p>Email phishing is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a 
                trusted person or entity.</p>
                <p>Smishing is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS), a technology that powers text messaging.
                 Smishing covers all forms of text messaging services, including Appleâ€™s iMessages, WhatsApp, and other chat mediums on phones.
                </p>
                <p>Vishing refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information over the phone.</p>
               <p> Spear phishing is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small 
                business.</p>
                <p>Whaling refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity Topics covered</h2>
            <p>In this section we shall cover some of the crucial topics that you as a user should be educated about and made
                aware of. The  cybersecurity awareness training curricula should reflect an organization's risk-based priorities 
                -- as well as, ideally, individual users' roles -- some topics are universally important. </p>
