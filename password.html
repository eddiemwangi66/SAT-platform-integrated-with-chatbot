    <h1>Password Security</h1>
   <p>We use many different passwords and systems. Many password managers will store a user's
     passwords for them so the user does not have to remember all their passwords for multiple systems. 
    The greatest disadvantage of these solutions is the risk of compromise of the password manager.</p>
    <p>These password managers may be protected by a weak password or passphrase chosen by the user and 
        easily compromised. There have been many cases where a personâ€™s private data was stored by a 
        cloud provider but easily accessed by unauthorized persons through password compromise.</p>
        <p>Organizations should encourage the use of different passwords for different systems and
             should provide a recommended password management solution for its users.</p>
             <p>Examples of poor password protection that should be avoided are:

                <p>Reusing passwords for multiple systems, especially using the same password for business and personal
                     use.</p>
                     <p> Writing down passwords and leaving them in unsecured areas.</p>
                        <p>Sharing a password with tech support or a co-worker.</p></p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Topics covered</h2>
    <p>In this section we shall cover some of the crucial topics that you as a user should be educated about and made
        aware of. The  cybersecurity awareness training curricula should reflect an organization's risk-based priorities 
        -- as well as, ideally, individual users' roles -- some topics are universally important. </p>
        <p>We shall dive deeply into the topics in the following page. click the next button below to continue.</p>
